<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The following paragraphs state that web pages which are part of this website may contain syntax errors or semantic errors due to the fact the author of this website (i.e. karbytes) has implemented a policy of setting a web page which is part of this website to be immutable after the year in which that web page was published is finished.</span></p>
<p>A <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">syntax</a> error is the detection of either an extra text character or else a missing text character (which may take the form of a misspelled word (e.g. “the black cet” instead of “the black cat”), a missing punctuation mark (e.g. “red blue, and green” instead of “red, blue, and green”), or an extra word (e.g. “the the cat” instead of “the cat”) inside of a finite linear sequence of text characters.</p>
<p>A <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semantic</a> error is the detection of incorrect logic which a finite linear sequence of text characters represents (which may take the form of an imbalanced algebraic equation such as “3 = 1 + 1” instead of “2 = 1 + 1”).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">A subset of what karbytes considers to be a semantic error within this website is the way <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlinks</a> to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">files</a> which are hosted externally to this website are colored in web pages which were published and finalized prior to 01_JANUARY_2023.</span></p>
<p>A hyperlink to a <strong style="background:#00ff00;color:#000000">code file</strong> which is hosted externally to this website is supposed to be rendered as having black text against a green background.</p>
<p>A hyperlink to a <strong style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000">non-code file</strong> which is hosted externally to this website is supposed to be rendered as having black text against an orange background.</p>
<p>A hyperlink to a <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00">code page</strong> within this website is supposed to be rendered as having green text against a black background.</p>
<p>A hyperlink to a <strong style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000">prose page</strong> within this website is supposed to be rendered as having orange text against a black background.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Hyperlinks which are displayed on the <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">START_PAGE</a> of this website and on each web page within this website which has been published on or after 01_JANUARY_2023 are required to exude the correct color conventions as described by the previous four paragraphs.</span></p>
<p>(Note that the START_PAGE of this website is considered by karbytes to be a code page because the start page displays a hyperlink to each code page within this website (which means that the START_PAGE of this website is interpreted by karbytes as being more of a code file directory than a prose file directory)).</p>

<p><strong>Archiving Process Initiation</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Each web page which was added to this website during the year 2022 (except for the START_PAGE of this website) is set to be an immutable time capsule artifact which verbatim preserves digital information from the year 2022.</p>
<p>Each web page which is added to this website during in the year 2023 is set to be malleable until the year 2024 (and then all web pages which are added to this website during the year 2023 which remain on this website on 01_JANUARY_2024 will be treated as immutable time capsule artifacts which verbatim preserve digital information from the year 2023).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Archiving Process Continuation</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>STEP_0: Let X represent a nonnegative integer value such that X initially represents the value 2024.</p>
<p>STEP_1: Then set each web page which is added to this website during the year X to be malleable until the year (X + 1).</p>
<p>STEP_2: On the first day of the year (X + 1) increment the nonnegative integer value which X represents by 1 and store that value in X.</p>
<p>STEP_3: Then set each web page which was added to this website before the year X to be immutable and un-removeable.</p>
<p>STEP_4: Jump to STEP_1.</p>
